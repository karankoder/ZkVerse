# zkPass Hackathon Submission

## **Project Name:** PayPal Integration - Verifiable Proof of Transaction History

### **Overview**

This schema allows users to securely verify their PayPal transaction history without exposing their full financial details. By leveraging zkPass’s zero-knowledge proof technology, users can prove specific transactions or transaction patterns to third parties while maintaining privacy and data integrity.

---

### **Use Case**

Enable seamless financial verification for applications such as loan approvals, credit assessments, and payment dispute resolutions without compromising sensitive financial data.

### **Schema Details**

```json
{
  "issuer": "PayPal",
  "desc": "Verify transaction history from PayPal without exposing full financial data.",
  "website": "https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/transactions/",
  "APIs": [
    {
      "host": "api.paypal.com",
      "intercept": {
        "url": "/v1/reporting/transactions",
        "method": "GET",
        "query": [
          {
            "start_date": "2024-01-01",
            "end_date": "2024-12-31",
            "fields": "all",
            "verify": true
          }
        ]
      },
      "assert": [
        {
          "key": "transaction_details|transactions|0|transaction_status",
          "value": "Completed",
          "operation": "="
        },
        {
          "key": "transaction_details|transactions|0|amount|value",
          "value": "100.00",
          "operation": ">="
        }
      ],
      "nullifier": "transaction_details|transactions|0|transaction_id"
    }
  ],
  "HRCondition": ["PayPal Transaction Verified"],
  "tips": {
    "message": "Log in to your PayPal account and navigate to the transaction history page. zkPass will securely verify the required transaction data."
  }
}
```

### **Features**

1. **Privacy-Preserving Verification**: Ensures that only the required transaction details are verified.
2. **Zero-Knowledge Proof**: Uses zkPass’s zkTLS to establish trust without revealing sensitive data.
3. **Ease of Integration**: Simplifies onboarding for third-party applications needing financial verification.

---

### **How It Works**

1. **User Authentication**: Users log in to their PayPal account and access their transaction history.
2. **Data Interception**: The schema intercepts transaction data using PayPal’s API.
3. **Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation**: zkPass validates required fields (e.g., transaction status, amount) without revealing additional details.
4. **Verification**: A zero-knowledge proof is generated and shared with the requesting third-party service.

---

### **Evaluation Criteria**

1. **Adherence to zkPass Guidelines**: Schema follows zkPass’s schema creation standards and zkTLS protocols.
2. **Innovation**: Enables financial verification use cases while ensuring user privacy.
3. **Technical Quality**: Efficient and compatible with zkPass infrastructure.
4. **Feasibility**: Practical application with real-world PayPal APIs.
5. **Impact**: Facilitates trustless financial transactions, enhancing zkPass’s ecosystem.

---

### **How to Use the Schema**

1. **Log in**: Access PayPal and navigate to the transaction history section.
2. **Start Verification**: Launch the zkPass verification process.
3. **Submit Proof**: Use the zero-knowledge proof generated by zkPass to share transaction verification with the requesting service.
